For part 1, I went through each number and run checks that
would determine if the number is safe or not.
For checks, I had different functions that would take care of that.
I first check if the number difference is safe (between 1 and 3)
then I check if the number are either asc or desc properly.
If these two properties are met, then the number is safe and I count it
towards the final answer.
